# React Integration

## Getting Started

Clone or fork the repo

Run `$ npm install` to install all the required packages.

Run `$ npm start` and make sure the application is running on `localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/`

## Possible application features to React-ify:
On **your** Quantified Self projects:
* Implement the same changes we just did on this repo, to build in that muscle memory
* Render the meals tables with a React component
* Render the list of foods on foods.html with a React component
* Create a controlled-form component on foods.html to add new foods


**Thanks to** @izaxveta and @marshallhouston for letting us use your project for this lesson!
